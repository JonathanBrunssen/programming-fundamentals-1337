### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
main()
{
  string name;
  cout << "What is your name? ";
  cin >> name;
  cout << "Hello " << name; << ".";
}
```
### Notes
  - "cin >>" is the character input for C++.
  - "cout<<" is the character output for C++.
  - "pow" is how you use the power method in C++.
  - pre processor [#define keyword value] where ever the program sees the keyword it replaces it with the value.
